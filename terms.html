        <div class="callout">
          <p><strong>CRITICAL DISCLAIMER:</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>3.1 Informational and Educational Purposes Only</h3>
        <p>THE SERVICES, INCLUDING ALL CONTENT, INFORMATION, RESPONSES, SCRIPTS, AND GUIDANCE PROVIDED THROUGH THE APP, ARE FOR INFORMATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. THE SERVICES ARE NOT INTENDED TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, OR THERAPY.</p>

        <h3>3.2 No Medical Professional Relationship</h3>
        <p>We are not medical professionals, licensed therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, or healthcare providers. No doctor-patient, therapist-client, or professional-client relationship is created by your use of the Services. The information provided through the Services does not constitute medical advice, mental health advice, or professional counseling.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Aggregated Information, Not Individual Assessment</h3>
        <p>The guidance provided by the App is based on an amalgamation of publicly available resources, books, podcasts, and general information about Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) and related parenting approaches. The App uses artificial intelligence trained on this aggregated content to generate responses.</p>
        <p>THE APP DOES NOT:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Assess your individual child's specific needs or situation</li>
          <li>Provide personalized medical, psychological, or therapeutic recommendations</li>
          <li>Diagnose any condition, including PDA or autism</li>
          <li>Replace the need for professional evaluation or treatment</li>
          <li>Account for your child's unique medical history, co-occurring conditions, or individual circumstances</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.4 Always Consult Qualified Professionals</h3>
        <p>ALWAYS SEEK THE ADVICE OF YOUR PHYSICIAN, THERAPIST, OR OTHER QUALIFIED HEALTH PROVIDER with any questions you may have regarding:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Your child's physical or mental health</li>
          <li>A medical condition or diagnosis</li>
          <li>Treatment options or interventions</li>
          <li>Medication or medical care</li>
          <li>Emergency situations or crisis scenarios</li>
        </ul>
        <p>NEVER DISREGARD PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL ADVICE OR DELAY IN SEEKING IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU HAVE READ OR RECEIVED THROUGH OUR SERVICES.</p>

        <h3>3.5 Emergency Situations</h3>
        <p>IF YOU OR YOUR CHILD ARE EXPERIENCING A MEDICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY, IMMEDIATELY CALL 911 (OR YOUR LOCAL EMERGENCY NUMBER) OR GO TO THE NEAREST EMERGENCY ROOM. DO NOT USE THE SERVICES FOR EMERGENCY SITUATIONS.</p>
        <p>The Services are not designed for crisis intervention and should never be used in place of emergency services, suicide prevention hotlines, or crisis counseling.</p>

        <h3>3.6 AI-Generated Content Limitations</h3>
        <p>The App uses artificial intelligence (AI) to generate responses. While we have taken care to train the AI on high-quality, PDA-specific content, AI-generated responses may:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Contain errors, inaccuracies, or outdated information</li>
          <li>Not account for your unique circumstances</li>
          <li>Be incomplete or require professional verification</li>
          <li>Not reflect the most current research or best practices</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should independently verify any information provided by the Services and consult with qualified professionals before making any decisions affecting your child's health, safety, or wellbeing.</p>

        <h3>3.7 Not a Substitute for Therapy or Professional Support</h3>
        <p>The Services do not replace the need for ongoing professional support, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Occupational therapy</li>
          <li>Speech therapy</li>
          <li>Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or other therapeutic interventions</li>
          <li>Psychological or psychiatric care</li>
          <li>Educational support and accommodations</li>
          <li>Social work or case management services</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3.8 Your Responsibility</h3>

        <h3>12.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
        <p>YOU AND PDA QUESTION AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.</p>

        <h3>12.5 Exceptions to Arbitration</h3>
        <p>Notwithstanding the above, either party may bring a lawsuit in court for:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Injunctive relief to protect intellectual property rights</li>
          <li>Claims that can be brought in small claims court</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>12.6 Opt-Out Right</h3>
        <p>You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by sending written notice to <a href="mailto:PDAQuestionApp@gmail.com">PDAQuestionApp@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "Arbitration Opt-Out" and including your name, address, and a clear statement that you wish to opt out of arbitration.</p>

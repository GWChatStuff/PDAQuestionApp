      <section class="section">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>This app was born from desperation, exhaustion, and love.</p>
        <p>We're parents of a 12-year-old with PDA. For years, we tried everything - behavioral therapists, reward charts, stricter boundaries, clearer expectations. Everything that was supposed to work.</p>
        <p>Everything made it worse.</p>
        <p>Our child wasn't defiant. They were terrified. And we were destroying our relationship by treating anxiety like disobedience.</p>
        <p>When we finally discovered PDA - and the low-demand, nervous-system-first approaches that actually help - everything changed. Not overnight. Not magically. But fundamentally.</p>
        <p>We learned to speak a different language. To see behavior through a different lens. To prioritize regulation over compliance, relationship over achievement, autonomy over control.</p>
        <p>Our child could finally breathe. So could we.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Why This App Had to Exist</h2>
        <p>Even after we understood PDA, the hardest moments were still incredibly hard.</p>
        <p>When your child is melting down at bedtime, you don't have time to search a Facebook group. When you're stuck in a homework battle, you can't pause to reread chapter seven of a book. When you're standing in Target with a screaming child and judgmental strangers, you need help right now.</p>
        <p>We needed PDA expertise available instantly. Not generic autism advice. Not behavioral strategies. Actual PDA-specific guidance from people who understood nervous systems, autonomy needs, and low-demand living.</p>
        <p>So we built it.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>The Brain Behind the App</h2>
        <p>PDA Question is powered by artificial intelligence that's been specially trained exclusively on PDA-specific content.</p>
        <p>We spent months curating the training data:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Hundreds of hours of expert PDA parent coaching transcripts</li>
          <li>Professional books written by leading PDA clinicians</li>
          <li>Therapeutic frameworks grounded in nervous system science</li>
          <li>Real strategies from real families navigating real challenges</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The AI doesn't search the internet. It doesn't guess. It doesn't pull from generic autism resources.</p>
        <p>It only knows PDA - deeply, comprehensively, and accurately.</p>
        <p>Every response reflects the same low-demand, autonomy-honoring, nervous-system-first approach that transformed our family. It's like having a PDA specialist in your pocket, available 24/7, for the cost of a single therapy session.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>What We Promise</h2>
        <p>This app will never:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Suggest behavioral modification or compliance-based strategies</li>
          <li>Recommend consequences, punishments, or reward systems</li>
          <li>Frame demand avoidance as manipulation or defiance</li>
          <li>Prioritize achievement over regulation</li>
          <li>Make you feel like you're failing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This app will always:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Honor your child's autonomy and nervous system needs</li>
          <li>Provide low-demand, relationship-first guidance</li>
          <li>Explain the why behind behaviors with compassion</li>
          <li>Support you in the hardest moments without judgment</li>
          <li>Evolve based on the latest PDA understanding</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>For Our Child</h2>
        <p>Ultimately, we built this for our 12-year-old.</p>
        <p>For the child who taught us that control is an illusion, that compliance isn't connection, and that some of the most brilliant, creative, passionate humans need the world to meet them differently.</p>
        <p>For every PDA child who's been called difficult, defiant, manipulative, or lazy - when they were really just drowning in anxiety.</p>
        <p>For every family trying to find a different way.</p>
        <p>If this app helps even one parent understand their child better, speak to them more gently, or respond with compassion instead of frustration in a hard moment - it will have been worth it.</p>

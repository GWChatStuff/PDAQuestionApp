        <h2>You're Not Imagining It</h2>
        <p>Your child isn't being defiant. Your parenting isn't failing. And you're not alone in feeling completely exhausted.</p>
        <p>Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) is a neurotype within autism where everyday requests trigger intense anxiety. What works for other autistic children - structure, rewards, clear expectations - can actually make things worse for PDA kids.</p>
        <p>You need support designed specifically for PDA. Not generic autism advice. Not behavioral strategies. Real help for real moments.</p>

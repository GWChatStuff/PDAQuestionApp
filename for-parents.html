        <h2>We Know</h2>
        <p>You're exhausted. Not just tired - bone-deep, soul-tired exhausted.</p>
        <p>You've tried everything. You've read the books, joined the Facebook groups, worked with therapists. Some days you're not sure you can do this anymore.</p>
        <p>You feel isolated because other parents don't understand. Even autism parents don't always get it. Their strategies don't work for your child. Their advice feels like judgment.</p>
        <p>You're doing an incredible job in an impossible situation.</p>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Actually Built for PDA</h2>
        <p>PDA Question understands that:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>You don't have time to read long articles when your child is melting down</li>
          <li>Generic autism advice doesn't work and sometimes makes things worse</li>
          <li>You need exact words to say not just "be patient" or "stay calm"</li>
          <li>You're making split-second decisions under immense stress</li>
          <li>You need support at 2am when everyone else is asleep</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every feature is designed for parents in crisis who need real help immediately.</p>

            <p>Every night is a war. Tears, yelling, hours of struggle over 15 minutes of work. You're dreading 3pm pickup.</p>

            <h3>Scenario 3: Public Meltdown</h3>
            <p>You're in the grocery store. Something triggered them. People are staring. You can feel the judgment. You need to get out but they can't move.</p>
            <hr class="soft">

            <h3>You're Not Alone</h3>
            <p>You're part of a community of parents navigating the same challenges. Parents who understand that compliance isn't the goal. Parents who know that keeping your child regulated matters more than finishing the worksheet.</p>
            <p>PDA Question gives you the expert support you deserve - without the waitlists, the cost, or the judgment.</p>
